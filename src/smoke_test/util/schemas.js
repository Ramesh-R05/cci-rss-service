        '1.7% are composers. Across 1,006 directors of the 900 films analysed, 53 were Black men, three were Black women, and two were Asian women.</p>\n<p>Representation in film is important because, if we&#39;re meant to see film as a reflection of narratives that matter to our population, right now it&#39;s still perpetuating the notion that only white, cisgender, straight, male, and able-bodied narratives matter. Filmmakers have used all' +
        ' sorts of excuses to justify these numbers, arguing that making characters women or LGBT wouldn&#39;t be honest to the stories they are trying to tell. But that&#39;s because they chose to tell those stories in the first place. They could choose different ones.</p>\n<p>So what&#39;s to be done? USC researchers say there are about 40 speaking characters in every movie, so if &quot;writers were to simply add five female speaking' +
        ' characters to every film, it would increase yearly the percentage of female characters on screen.&quot; It&#39;s a small ask, given that these could be inconsequential background characters, but it would lead to equal representation of women on screen by 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Raphael Bob-Waksberg</strong>, the creator of <em>BoJack Horseman</em>, spoke about how obvious a choice this was to make — once it was pointed out to him by head' +
        ' designer <strong>Lisa Hanawalt</strong>. He said there is a &quot;tendency for comedy writers, and audiences, and writers... to view comedy characters as inherently male, unless there is something <em>specifically</em> female about them,&quot; and that until Hanawalt started designing characters he had assumed were men as women, he didn&#39;t realise he was making this assumption.</p>\n<p>&quot;The underlying assumption there is that the default' +
        ' mode for any character is male, so to make the characters female is an additional detail <em>on top of that</em>,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In case I&#39;m not being a hundred percent clear, this thinking is stupid and wrong and self-perpetuating unless you actively work against it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Still, background character equality is a low bar to clear. USC also recommends high-profile talent add equity clauses in their contracts, which' +
        ' would specify &quot;a more equitable process for auditioning and casting on‐screen talent and interviewing and hiring for behind‐the‐camera jobs,&quot; and that shareholders make these demands of companies.
